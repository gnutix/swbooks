# wrapper-demo (skeleton)

### development

`wrapper-demo` uses `grunt` so make sure that the grunt cli is installed:

```bash
$ [sudo] npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Install dev depencencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

As you work, run `grunt` initially and it will watch, and lint on change.

```bash
$ grunt
```

### build

Builds based on package info into `/dist/`

```bash
$ grunt build
```
